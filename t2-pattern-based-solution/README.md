# T2 - Pattern-Based Solution

This directory contains the implementation using the Strategy Design Pattern.

## Purpose

This solution demonstrates how to apply the Strategy Design Pattern to create a flexible and maintainable implementation.

## Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Instructions

Add your Strategy pattern implementation files to this directory.
